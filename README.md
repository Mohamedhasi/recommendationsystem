# Recommendation System with Flask API
This project is a recommendation system built to suggest products based on user interactions and similarities. It uses collaborative filtering techniques, including matrix factorization (SVD), to generate personalized recommendations. The system is hosted on a Flask API, allowing real-time access to recommendations for any user.

Features
Collaborative Filtering: Uses user-item interactions and cosine similarity for recommendations.
Matrix Factorization: Leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to improve recommendation accuracy.
Real-Time API: Provides a Flask-based API for fetching recommendations dynamically.

Technologies Used

Python: Main programming language.
Flask: For building the REST API.
Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn, SciPy: For similarity calculations and SVD implementation.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: For visualizing data insights.
